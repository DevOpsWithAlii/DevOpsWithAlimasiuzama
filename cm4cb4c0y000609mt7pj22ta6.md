## **\-: Overview of Jenkins:-**

### Jenkins:

Jenkins is a Java-based open-source automation platform(server) with plugins designed for continuous integration processes in an automated fashion.

### Jenkins used for what?

\-Jenkins is used to **build** and **test** your product **continuously**, so developers can continuously integrate changes into the build.  
\-Jenkins is the most popular open-source CI/CD tool on the market today and is used in support of DevOps, alongside other cloud-native tools.

### Why Jenkins came into the picture?

Jenkins came into the picture to address the challenges in software development, such as `repetitive tasks,` `manual interventions`, and `inconsistent build and deployment processes`.  
As software projects grew in complexity, manual tasks like `building`, `testing`, and `deploying code` became time-consuming and `error-prone`. Its flexibility, extensibility, and ability to integrate with various tools made it a popular choice for teams seeking to improve their development workflows and deliver software faster and with higher quality.  
Jenkins emerged as an open-source solution that offered developers a way to `automate tasks`, `integrate different tools`, and `establish continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.` This helped teams achieve faster development cycles, better collaboration, and more reliable software releases…

### Continuous Integration:

Continuous integration is a procedure to integrate all the code changes done by several developers in one project. A code is repeatedly tested after a commit to guarantee the code is error and bug-free.

### Continuous Deployment:

Continuous Deployment aims at continuously releasing the code changes into the production environment.

### Continuous Delivery:

Continuous Delivery is a software engineering practice where the code changes are prepared to be released.

* Start Jenkins service - <mark>systemctl start jenkins</mark>
    
* Enable port 8080 on your ec2 instance and access the URL to get the Jenkins UI page  
    **http://{ec2-public-dns}:8080**
    
* Log in using the **username admin** and to get the **initial admin password** go to this location on your Jenkins server created on ec2 and run the command:  
    <mark>sudo cd /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword</mark>
    
* Copy the password and paste it to the URL page at the Administrator password options below
