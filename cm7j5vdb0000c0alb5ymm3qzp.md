### Kubernetes Overview

**What is Kubernetes?**

**<mark>Kubernetes</mark>** also known as **<mark>K8s</mark>** was built by Google based on their experience running containers in production. It is now an open-source project and is arguably one of the best and most popular container orchestration technologies out there.

To understand Kubernetes, we must first understand two things â€“ **<mark>Container and Orchestration</mark>**.

**<mark>Containers:</mark>**  
Containers are completely isolated environments, as in they can have their own processes or services, their own network interfaces, and their own mounts, just like Virtual machines, except that they all share the same OS kernel.

**<mark><br>Orchestration:</mark>** It is a technique that refers to the automated management and deployment of containerized applications across a clustered environment.

**<mark>Kubernetes:</mark>**

Kubernetes is known for its powerful orchestration capabilities, which enable the efficient operation of containerized workloads in a distributed environment.

**<mark>What benefits of using k8s:</mark>**

1. Automated Container deployments with scaling, load balancing, High Availability capabilities
    
2. Automated Application Deployments
    
3. Service discovery and load balancing
    
4. Automated rollouts and rollbacks
    
5. Self-healing
    
6. Secret and configuration management
    

\-Application is highly available as hardware failures do not bring the application down because you have multiple instances of your application running on different nodes.

\-The user traffic is load balanced across the various containers. When demand increases, deploy more instances of the application seamlessly and within a matter of seconds.

\-When we run out of hardware resources, scale the number of nodes up/down without having to take down the application.

When you install Kubernetes on a System, you are installing the following components.  
`An API Server`  
`An ETCD service`  
`A kubelet service`  
`A Container Runtime, Controllers and Schedulers`.

**<mark>What is Control Plane?</mark>**

The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster.

**<mark>Write the difference between kubectl and kubelets.</mark>**

`kubectl` is the command-line interface (CLI) tool for working with a Kubernetes cluster.

`Kubelet` is the technology that applies, creates, updates, and destroys containers on a Kubernetes node.

**<mark>Explain the role of the API server.</mark>**

The API server acts as the front-end for Kubernetes. The users, management devices and Command line interfaces all talk to the API server to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
